# Unity Projects
This repository contains the scripts for Unity projects that I do for the purpose of practice or am otherwise happy to make public. These projects are my first experiences with C# and object-oriented programming.

## Tutorial Projects
Projects that were made by following a tutorial.

### Roll a Ball [[Download]](https://mega.nz/#!KhQgxBgT!pvlEKbkilkBpdiaNdiZn6C2Vo2n5zqlramQ7QUkI-j4) (April 19, 2017)
My rendition of the first Unity [tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial). Nothing particularly special about it other than it's my first Unity project.
- Roll a ball around.
- Grab a bunch of rotating cubes.
- Don't even have the ability to restart ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### Space Shooter [[Download]](https://mega.nz/#!KwJDWRoR!-_g4zt1gT3zF8vN_vFVUxJxXGOuqKdRQ-MzOXgyIfyk) (April 21, 2017)
My rendition of the second Unity [tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial). Again, nothing particularly interesting. My second Unity project. I completed the extended tutorial. With the knowledge gained from these first two tutorials, I felt ready to attempt my own, non-tutorial project (see Race the Sun Remake).
- Randomly placed asteroids.
- Randomly placed enemy ships that maneuver.
- Randomly placed power ups that increase the player's attack speed (not originally part of the tutorial).
- Score based on the number of asteroids destroyed.
- Asteroids with randomly spawned models and textures.
- Can restart this one!

## Original Projects
Projects that I developed, unaided by tutorials.

### Race the Sun Remake [[Download]](https://mega.nz/#!H1pBUQqZ!hnw-denD2tkhf1V39zaU7H54utnIiI707Kv68kLrR14) (April 26, 2017)
My humble attempt at trying to recreate Race the Sun [[Website]](http://flippfly.com/racethesun/) [[Steam]](http://store.steampowered.com/app/253030/Race_The_Sun/), another game created in Unity. This was my first independent attempt at a Unity game after having completed the Roll a Ball and Space Shooter tutorials. 
Pretty barebones, but it contains the basics. Features include:
- Randomly generated obstacles.
- Distance-dependent score-keeping.
- Simulated sun-set dependent on player speed.
- Gradual difficulty increase.
- Randomly placed speed-boosts.
- Speed-dependent field of view.
- Looping left-right obstacles.
- A soundtrack [[YT Link]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDCIIiRVooc).

### Top-Down Shooter [[Download]](https://mega.nz/#!O8hyHb7T!5s8nx-8m1aq-TwMVyTPSMwD5HdJZ2FX8wi8l6iBVxWs) (May 22, 2017)
A simple top down arena shooter. Wanted to make something involving cursor position.
- Player can move around within a square and shoot at the zombies.
- "Zombies" spawn at the edges of the screen and move towards the player.
- Zombie spawn rate and movement speed increases over time.
- Choose difficulty from easy, medium, or hard.
- Gun upgrades spawn on occasion. Picking these up increases the number of guns the player has.
- A soundtrack [[YT Link]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hppMvp5nA1U)
- Can pause!
- Can exit!

### Castle Defender [[Download]](https://mega.nz/#!7tRAnaRJ!yEh29TVLusIG-7kLh-PFCt2hENM77t6uIxh5qCtqP_s) (August 03, 2017) (Work in progress)
A first person pseudo-tower defender. Currently in its earliest stages. Planned features include:
- Roaming atop the walls of your castle.

- Use guns and explosives to defend your castle.
- Ragdoll physics
- Sound effects

Right now includes:
- Walk around in first-person.
- Point and shoot at moving enemies.
- Firing animation, recoil, zooming with right click.
- Working lift to get back onto castle walls if fallen off.
- Sound effects.
- Defend castle gate and houses inside walls from waves of spawning enemies.
- Gradual difficulty increase.
- Ammo system.
- A shop to purchase ammunition and guns from.
- Swap weapons with 1 - 4, provided you have purchased the weapons.

For a detailed plan of features, see Castle Defender/Assets/To do.xlsx/.
