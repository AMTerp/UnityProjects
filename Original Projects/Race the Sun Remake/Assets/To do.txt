Todo:
	- Polish the speed boosts' gradual speed up.
	- Make the ground not move weirdly when pickup speedboost.
	- Fix minor glitch of blocks moving when teleporting lane sides.
	- Fix having two speed ups at the same time both manipulating down_speed.
		- Maybe prevent speed ups from spawning quickly consecutively.
